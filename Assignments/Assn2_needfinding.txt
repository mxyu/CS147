Evan
-Does not have a camera, only a smartphone (AT&T phone)
-Does GPS tagging but he does not take enough photos to really need the function
-Uses Dropbox as a way to connect his phone to his computer. Has bought ~250GB of storage on Dropbox that he just pays for month by month
-Never feels compelled to delete photos
-Does not need to delete photos yet on his phone since the space has not all been used up
-All photos are time-stampted (in the file name)
-All photos are in his photos folder in Dropbox, no organization other than being able to sort them with computer functions
-Does not post photos on Facebook anymore since he just gets backed up with photos and ends up not posting anything
-If a friend wants him to send him a photo, he just looks through his photos until he finds the photo(s)
-Takes photos for "memories", sometimes just takes photos to take note of things (like posters, will look at them later, or to remember places and dates of things)

Pablo
-Has a very old phone, a "brick" that he does not care to take photos with
-Had a camera abroad, only took ~5 photos. They are still sitting in the camera
-Does not take pictures also because he does not want to deal with the photos
	-If there were an automatic way to upload photos somewhere, would he take photos?
-If he had a smartphone, he would probably take photos. In order to show them to people, he would just use his phone.
-He feels no need to take photos, especially since when he goes places, other people usually take photos and make them available on Facebook
	-What does he think about documentation in general?
	-How does he keep track of things?
-If someone asks him for a photo, he will try to look for it (no organization of his photos) or he will just sometime say he lost it. It will be up to him to decide how much effort he wants to spend finding a picture.
	-If there was an easier way to locate pictures, would this still happen?

Stephanie
-Has a SONY camera, takes photos at events, may not upload until a long time after the event. Pictures from many events accumulate in her camera.
-Has to manually delete photos from her camera
-In order to transfer photos from her camera to her computer, she has to find the cord which connects the camera to her computer. Sometimes she cannot find the cord and then has to search for it; sometimes she gives up and tries again at a later time
-Has to transfer photos to a folder that she makes on her desktop. Sometimes these folders also accumulate on her desktop and then she will eventually clean them up once they start to look like an annoying mass of folders.
-She uses Dropbox now, but only as a backup. Photos will automatically sync from her camera to Dropbox. She does not use Dropbox to manage photos
-She also has an iPhone, which she occasionally takes pictures with. When she wants to transfer a picture onto her computer, she emails it to herself. If there is more than one picture, she finds the cord and plugs it into her computer and transfers the photos.
-She does not delete photos on her phone
-She does not usually delete photos on her camera, unless she needs to for the sake of space
-Sometimes friends asking for pictures is the initiating force for getting her to put photos on her computer from her camera.
-To take notes, she sometimes takes pictures with her phone. Mostly just takes notes in the "Notes" app.
-Would like to do the "take a picture a day" thing but says she would probably end up stressing out about finding the best picture all the time and it would just become too time-consuming. Would take too many pictures.
-Blogged about working in a bakery, took photos and wrote about them. Became time consuming after she took 5-6 photos a day. Still has not updated the last couple weeks' worth of pictures.

-Organize photos? Where do those folders go? What happens when you have that awkward one picture? Where to file it?


-Has to find an iPhone USB cord. He looks around his friends' drawers for one.
-Clicks "cancel" when Dropbox asks whether he would like to sync his photos to Dropbox
-Uses ImageCapture to import photos, manually selects photos he wants to import into a new folder on his Desktop. He is unable to preview and screen the photos in ImageCapture so he has to import all candidate photos and preview them in the Finder.
-He then looks through the photos and deletes the ones he does not want to put on Facebook
-
-Deletes photos often whenever looking through pictures, anything that isn't useful anymore like a screen shot of Caltrain timetables or map directions
-Hasn't gotten to the point where he has to delete photos he has already uploaded since he still has plenty of memory on his phone, but would start deleting if need arises
-One folder on desktop for posting to Facebook, sits around and becomes stale on Desktop. Delete after a couple months after realizing photos have been uploaded. 
-Doesn't keep a copy on computer, only on phone, doesn't want a backup. They're on Facebook so whatever.
-Awkward single pictures sit on desktop, until he decides to get rid of them and just moves all things on the desktop at that cleaning period into a folder somewhere.
-Usually uploads right after an epic adventure or after an accumulation of things that could comprise an album.
